# Walkie Talkie Time Mod

### Please report any issues [here](https://github.com/belea-mcqcm/WalkieTalkieTimeMod/issues).

A mod for Lethal Company that displays the time when holding an on walkie-talkie, even when inside the facility or the ship.

## Config file options

Setting `ShowTimeOnlyWithWalkieTalkie = false` (default) will show the clock normally outside and with an on walkie-talkie elsewhere. Setting it to `true` shows the clock _only_ when holding an on walkie-talkie, even outside.

Clients' config files _should_ sync with the host's, giving everyone the same settings. Settings revert after leaving host's server.

## Installation

This mod can be automatically installed through the Thunderstore mod manager.
